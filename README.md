This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Basic Use? ###
You can place tss-icon-styles icons just about anywhere using a CSS style prefix and the iconï¿½s name. tss-icon-styles is designed to be used with inline elements (we like the <i> tag for brevity, but using a <span> is more semantically correct).

```
<i  class="icon-user"></i>
```
tss-icon-styles icons automatically inherit CSS size and color. This means they blend in with text inline wherever you put them.

  

### Sample Example 
```
Go to angular.json and add styles.css in
"styles": [
            "./node_modules/tss-icon-styles/styles.css"
        ],
You can get icons with any elements, check below.       
<body>
    <i class="icon-user"></i>
    <span class="icon-user"></span>
</body>
```
 
### Prefix ###

tss-icon-styles icons use own prefix is "icon-".
