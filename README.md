This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### Basic Use? ###
You can place tss-styles icons just about anywhere using a CSS style prefix and the iconï¿½s name. tss-styles is designed to be used with inline elements (we like the <i> tag for brevity, but using a <span> is more semantically correct).

```
<i  class="icon-user"></i>
```
tss-styles icons automatically inherit CSS size and color. This means they blend in with text inline wherever you put them.

  

### Sample Example 
```
<head>
<!--core first + styles last-->
<link  href="/static/tss-styles/styles.css"  rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
<i class="icon-user"></i>
</body>
```
 
### Prefix ###

tss-styles icons use own prefix is "icon-".
